The video file is firstly uploaded from our frontend into our backend
We then split up the file, extracting the audio in FFMPEG
After the audio is finally extracted, we then upload the audio file to the google cloud platform in the form of a bucket
Once finally uploaded, we then execute a python script running Google speech-to-text AI model transcribing the content of the lecture
Once we have gotten the transcription, we then pass this returned data into the SassBook API, returning summarized texts
We return the SassBook response as an output
We additionally parse the SassBook response through a question generation natural-language processing model, generating corresponding questions and answers We then pass this via JSON to our ANKI FlashDeck generator, which converts these Questions + Answers into related flashcards as an ANKI deck for spaced repetition practice
We then additionally run a word frequency counter on the google speech-to-text transcription
We first pre-process the clip removing filler words such as "and," "our," "uh," and "uhms."
We then run a word frequency calculator determining the most relevant words/phrases and adding this to a tag list
This is submitted to the frontend with a REST API
