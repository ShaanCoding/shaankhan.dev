    Select a polygon P from the list
    Make a node N in the BSP tree, and add P to the list of polygons at that node.

    For each other polygon in the list:
        If that polygon is wholly in front of the plane containing P:
            Move that polygon to the list of nodes in front of P.
        If that polygon is wholly behind the plane containing P:
            Move that polygon to the list of nodes behind P.
        If that polygon is intersected by the plane containing P:
            Split it into two polygons and move them to the respective lists of polygons behind and in front of P.
        If that polygon lies in the plane containing P:
            Add it to the list of polygons at node N.

    Apply this algorithm to the list of polygons in front of P.
    Apply this algorithm to the list of polygons behind P.

    For each polygon P from list:
