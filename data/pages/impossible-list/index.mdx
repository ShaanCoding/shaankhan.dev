This is my impossible list. Instead of a bucket list, this is a list of things that I am actively working towards. I will be updating this list as I complete things and add new things to it.

> This page is inspired by Thomas Frank's [Impossible List](https//collegeinfogeek.com/impossible-list/)

> Likewise, this page is very personal, and I don't expect anyone to read it. It's more of a public declaration of my goals and dreams. Whilst these goals may not be impressive to some, they are important to me, and I hope to achieve them.
