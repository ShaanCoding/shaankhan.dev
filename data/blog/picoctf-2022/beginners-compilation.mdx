## Binary Exploitation

<div className="invisible !h-0">

### basic-file-exploit

</div>

<Challenge
    title="basic-file-exploit"
    authors="Will Hong"
    solvers="jktrn"
    category="pwn"
    points="100"
    description="The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! Connect to the program with netcat:  
    `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 50366`"
/>

Let's connect to the server using `netcat` to see what's going on:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bfe-first-netcat" rawHTML terminal />

Since this is the binary exploitation category, we'll be looking for a vulnerability in the source code that allows us to either break or control the program at a lower level. Let's view the attachment `program-redacted.c`:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bfe-attachment" language="c" scrollable />

In the midst of this complex program, we need to figure out where the flag is, and how to trigger it to print:

<CodeBlock
    src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bfe-attachment"
    language="c"
    skipLines={[[16, 142]]}
    range={[[15, 147]]}
    added={[[143, 144]]}
/>

The flag is defined in line 13 as `"[REDACTED]"`, which will be the actual location on the remote server. From lines 139-143 it looks like a condition needs to be met in order to `puts()` the flag, which writes a string to the output stream `stdout`.

Google defines `strtol()` as a function that "converts the initial part of the string in **str** to a **long int** value according to the given **base**". To break it, we need to input something that is **unconvertible into a long integer**. In this case, it would be a string, as they can't be properly coalesced into long integers!

This if statement is located within a function called `data_read()`. Let's see where it's called in the program:

<CodeBlock
    src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bfe-attachment"
    language="c"
    range={[[179, 185]]}
/>

After we write some data with the command `1`, We should be pressing the command `2` to read from the stored data. Once it prompts us to "enter the entry number of your data", we'll send a string instead to break it. Let's head back to the `netcat` and test it out:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bfe-last-netcat" rawHTML terminal />

### CVE-XXXX-XXXX

<Challenge
    title="CVE-XXXX-XXXX"
    authors="Mubarak Mikail"

    description="Enter the CVE of the vulnerability as the flag with the correct flag format - `picoCTF{CVE-XXXX-XXXXX}` - replacing `XXXX-XXXXX` with the numbers for the matching vulnerability.

This is a really trivial challenge. You can actually google "first recorded remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in 2021" and it will be the first result:

<Challenge
    title="ropfu"
    authors={['Sanjay C.', 'Lt. "Syreal" Jones']}
    solvers="jktrn"
    category="pwn"
    points="300"
    description="What's ROP?

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/ropfu-checksec" rawHTML terminal />

Hey, look: a classic "ROP" (return-oriented programming) challenge with the source code provided! Let's take a look:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/ropfu-attachment" language="c" />

The source only provides us with one vulnerable function: `gets()`. I've gone over this extremely unsafe function multiple times now, so feel free to read [MITRE's Common Weakness Enumeration page](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/242) if you don't know why. There is also no convenient function with `execve("/bin/sh", 0, 0)` in it (for obvious reasons), so we will have to insert our own shellcode.

Although we could totally solve this the old-fashioned way (as John Hammond did in [his writeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7wNN8qgxAA)), we can use the power of automation with a tool called [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget)! Let's try using it here to **automatically** build the ROP-chain for us, which will eventually lead to a [syscall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call):

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/ropfu-ropchain" rawHTML terminal />

Oh, wow. It generated the entire script for us (unfortunately in Python2), with only a few missing bits and bobs! The only things we need to manually configure now are the offset and remote connection. Since the `checksec` mentioned that there was a canary enabled, it looks like we'll have to manually guess the offset with the `$eip`:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/ropfu-gdb" rawHTML terminal />

The offset is 28, as we've successfully loaded 4 hex `B`s into the `$eip`. Our last step is to set up the remote connection with [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/). Here is my final script:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/ropfu-solve" language="python" scrollable />

Let's run the script:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/ropfu-run" rawHTML terminal />

I know the way of ROP-fu, old man. Your shell has been snatched.

### basic-mod1

</div>

<Challenge
    title="basic-mod1"
    authors="Will Hong"
    solvers="jktrn"
    category="crypto"
    points="100"
    description="We found this weird message being passed around on the servers, we think we have a working decryption scheme.  
    Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set - 0-25 is the alphabet (uppercase), 26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an underscore. Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. `picoCTF{decrypted_message}`)"
/>

Let's go over what it's asking:

-   Calculate `% 37` for each number
-   Map each number to this specific charset:
    -   0-25 = Uppercase alphabet (A-Z)
    -   26-35 = Decimal digits (0-9)
    -   36 = Underscore ("\_")

I was too lazy to learn Python and do that, so here it is in native Javascript:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bm1-solve-js" language="javascript" />

Looking back at the problem after I learned Python, here's a solution that's significantly cleaner:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bm1-solve-py" language="python" />

Running the scripts:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bm1-run" rawHTML terminal />

    category="crypto"
    points="100"
    description="A new modular challenge! Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. Then map to the following character set - 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore.

/>

Let's go over what it's asking once again:

-   Calculate `% 41` for each number
-   Map each number to this specific charset:
    -   1-26 = Uppercase alphabet (A-Z)
    -   27-36 = Decimal digits (0-9)
    -   37 = Underscore ("\_")

Here's a stupidly long Javascript snippet I made to solve this:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/bm2-solve" language="javascript" />

### credstuff

</div>

<Challenge
    title="credstuff"
    authors={['Will Hong', "Lt. 'Syreal' Jones"]}
    solvers={['MrTeaa', 'jktrn']}
    category="crypto"
    points="100"
    description="We found a leak of a blackmarket website's login credentials. Can you find the password of the user `cultiris` and successfully decrypt it?  
    The first user in `usernames.txt` corresponds to the first password in `passwords.txt`. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on."
/>

We're initially provided a `leak.tar` archive. On extraction, we're presented with two files: `usernames.txt` and `passwords.txt`:

<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-4 md:flex-row">
    <div>
        <CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/credstuff-usernames" language="text" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/credstuff-passwords" language="text" />
    </div>
</div>

Let's go to the username `cultiris`. The `-n` tag in `grep` will enable line numbers:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/credstuff-grep" rawHTML terminal />

Let's fine the equivalent line in `passwords.txt`:

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/credstuff-search" rawHTML />

On line 378 it looks like there's a flag obfuscated with shift cipher. Let's brute force this on [DCode](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher):

<CodeBlock src="picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/credstuff-dcode" rawHTML />

<Box text="**credstuff**: `picoCTF{C7r1F_54V35_71M3}`" type="flag" />

### morse-code

<Challenge
    title="morse-code"

    category="crypto"
    points="100"
    description="Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this?  
    Wrap your answer with `picoCTF{}`, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase."
/>

We're presented with a `morse_chal.wav` file:

<div className="my-4 flex items-center justify-center">
    <audio controls>
        <source src="/static/images/picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/morse_chal.wav" />
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
</div>

We could totally decode this by hand using [Audacity's](https://www.audacityteam.org/) visualizer, but that's super time-consuming. Instead, I opted for an automatic audio-based [Morse decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) online:

![Automatic Morse Decoding](/static/images/picoctf-2022/beginners-compilation/morse-code.gif)

The program outputs `WH47 H47H 90D W20U9H7`. Following the conversion instructions, the final flag is:

<Box text="**morse-code**: `picoCTF{wh47_h47h_90d_w20u9h7}`" type="flag" />

<Box
    text={
        'Fun fact: this string is a leetspoken version of "What hath God wrought", which was the first telegraphed message in Morse!'
    }
    type="info"
/>
