## 2025-02-27

Update: 
Designed (a) landing page, realised it looks pretty generic so I might just write up a comission spec and outsource the design (should take 4 weeks so I'll write it up on the weekend to send out)
Messed around with a bunch of sketches and came up with a rough flow of the app
Implemented 3 of the pages as UI mocks (taking hardcoded data)

Will spend tomorrow implementing the "Core" page which has like 4 forms and then I should be ready to do a round of refactoring + adding states and replacing the mocks with proper data
