## Intro

So, we played BYUCTF 2022. There were **9 OSINT challenges**. 9. It was absolutely party-time for a CTF player w/ OSINT-emphasis like me, and a tragedy for people who dislike the inherently guessy nature behind the genre. Our team managed to solve them all, so here was our (albeit flawed) thought process behind it.

<Box
    type="info"
    text="**Important note**: Some of our lines of reasoning don't make sense at all. That's normal for this category, and it comes from a crap ton of brainstorming, guesswork, and admin communication. I'll try my best to include wrong paths that we took, but for the sake of brevity some of it will be omitted."
/>

Oh, also, here is a haiku to express my carnal, passionate, burning hatred for OSINT:

<div className="text-center"> 
> Submerged in my tears,  
> I yearn for painless release.  
> The dreadful OSINT...

Thank you, and enjoy.

I did a quick [Google Lens](https://lens.google/) search with my phone with the keyword "BYU" attached and [this](https://universe.byu.edu/2012/09/27/5-campus-locations-you-didnt-know-existed/) article turned up:

> Jason Turner is a BYU computer science program graduate who works at DreamWorks and created all the data for Po’s character. The statue is a tribute to his success, as well as the University’s program and alumni.

Since the tribute is for Jason Turner, we can assume the signature is below his foot. The flag is `byuctf{Jason_Turner}`.

Once again, I used Google Lens to figure out where the location of this image was. Turns out to be a place called the "Lizard's Mouth Rock" in Santa Barbara County, California:

<Image

    width="300"
    height="450"

<figcaption>*Lizard's Mouth Rock* Google search</figcaption>

The image given to us is a direct screenshot of an image posted by Maps contributor [Jonathan P.](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104742787928495148360), although that has little relevance to the challenge.

Moving on, although we have the location of the image taken the flag is in _explicit format_, meaning that it's somewhere on the internet wrapped with `byuctf{...}`. We noticed that a guy named "Sam" was mentioned, so we guessed that we could find him leaving a review of the place on a platform.

We checked through the following platforms: Yelp, Google Reviews, TripAdvisor, AllTrails — yet, we couldn't find a recent reviewer by the name of Sam. Luckily, one of my team members searched up "Bouldering Lizard's Mouth" (based on the challenge name) and happened to stumble across [this website](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105885134/the-lizards-mouth):

We scrolled down to the "Reviews" section and found this:

Hey, look! Another Google Lens problem! Although there's a lot of blue water towers out there, I luckily stumbled across one that looked really similar in Flint, Michigan:

<Image src="/static/images/byuctf-2022/squatter2.png" width="300" height="300" />

Going to the [webpage](http://www.eureka4you.com/water-michigan/MI-Flint1.htm), it mentions that this water tower is in "Genesee County. Mid Michigan.", so with a quick Maps search I stumble across the "Wyatt P. Memorial Water Tower":

![Google Maps Search](/static/images/byuctf-2022/squatter3.png)

This is where the rabbit hole begins. I looked around the reviews section of this place and found the absolute weirdest, most hilarious reviews of all time:

> In all my days, I have never seen such a magnificent water tower. Being in its presence has given me powers beyond comprehension. I have mastered flight in the downward direction. I have 100% recall of events that happened to me in the last 5 minutes. I have also discovered I am completely invisible when no one is looking. This water tower has changed my view of who I am, and my ultimate potential.

<figcaption>— Robert Skouson</figcaption>

This guy even claims it to be holy water:

> This water from Wyatt P. Memorial Water tower has changed the way I see water, and drink it. Every time I see this water tower, it makes me want quality water. Forget Poland Spring or Fiji. This is quality water! You know how in the Book of John Chapter 2, the Savior Jesus Christ turned water into wine? Well he actually turned already good wine to water from Wyatt P. Memorial Water tower.

<figcaption>— Nicholas Martinez</figcaption>

This one might be my favorite:

> Professionally speaking as a water tower enthusiast, this has to be one of the best water towers that I've ever visited and I've visited thousands. The divine structure of the 10 legs leading to the plumply, robust water basin is enough to get any man excited. The satisfying twang as you bang the side wall sends shivers down even the most hardened of souls. Never before has such a feat been attempted and accomplished. Truly this should be the EIGHTIETH WONDER OF THE WORLD.

<figcaption>— McKay Lush</figcaption>

I actually stumbled across the person it's named after, Wyatt Pangerl, and I was super curious as to what the hell was going on:

![Wyatt](/static/images/byuctf-2022/squatter4.png)

So I opened a ticket. Turns out, this Wyatt guy, a member of their team, managed to get the water tower named after himself after a series of divine, godlike social engineering strategies (assumedly to the county) and exploitation of the [Squatter's Rights](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/squatters-rights-law-california-45887.html) law in California. He also claimed the location on Google Maps and put his burner phone there as well, which we called (he didn't pick up). When I found his Facebook (will not disclose), I saw a multitude of his friends commenting hilarious crap, calling him "ICONIC." and a "LEGEND." for managing to make it happen.

Yet, there was no flag.

I continued to look around and managed to fall deeper into the rabbit hole, OSINTing everything between the model of [Wyatt's car](https://www.kbb.com/chrysler/crossfire/2006/), a Chrysler Crossfire 2006 (🤣) to where his parents file taxes... I even managed to get an award from a head admin for being a dumbass:

![Discord screenshot of award](/static/images/byuctf-2022/squatter5.png)

Then, while on the go, I checked the location on my phone... And look what we've got:

<Image src="/static/images/byuctf-2022/squatter6.png" width="400" height="300" />

Apparently for whatever stupid, scatter-brained, vapid, moronic reason this "From the owner" section isn't on Google Chrome. Screw you Wyatt, and your majestic, plump, baby-blue water tower. The flag is `byuctf{h0w_d1d_1_st34l_4_w4t3r_t0w3r}`. Once again, screw you Wyatt. I hope your taxes are messed up forevermore.

<Box

## Okta? More like OhNah

    description={
        'Recently, the group known as LAPSUS$ released indications they breached Microsoft & one of the Largest SSO companies, Okta.

    }
/>

Looks like a challenge regarding an infamous hacking group. Seeing that the flag asks for a timestamp and the language is pseudo-colloquial, I'd safely assume that this text mentioned somewhere came from a messaging board. I downloaded _Telegram_, their main method of communication with the real world, joining their [announcements board](https://t.me/minsaudebr), yet upon a `Ctrl` + `F` I couldn't find this message anywhere. Their board mentions a [group chat](https://t.me/saudechat), but it was recently purged and terminated. When the admin confirmed that this wasn't the intended solution, I moved towards looking for screenshots surrounding the Okta leak. Our team found this [tweet from John Hammond](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1506166671664463875) after a while:

The flag is `byuctf{port_scanning_11:22}`. A hint was later added to the challenge:

> think screenshots! it is not on telegram but another platform with that same first letter. tweeted by a famous red head i think

It would have been much easier with this information... love you, John Hammond.

    title="Murder Mystery"
    solvers={['Battlemonger', 'jktrn']}

    description="While searching for secrets of the past, you find a scrap of paper that contains the following information:

        **Note**: the flag will not include the name or dates found in the inscription."
/>

Instantly, we moved to [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for the binary conversion, and it resulted in `nrhpidLKÐ`. We thought it was garbage at first, until a teammate noticed "NRHP ID" within the string, which is related to the [National Register of Historic Places](https://history.idaho.gov/nrhp/). Since there's a historic date also in the description, we can immediately conclude that this is the correct path to take. We isolated the last part and converted it into decimal instead - `80002319`.

Following the trail for `NRHP ID 80002319`, we found this [UpWiki Page](https://en.upwiki.one/wiki/Jesse_James_Home_Museum) About the "Jesse James Home Museum", which is the location registered under this ID.

When we looked up "jesse james famous inscription", we found a [Smithsonian Magazine](https://photocontest.smithsonianmag.com/photocontest/detail/the-original-grave-site-of-jesse-james-located-in-the-yard-of-the-james-fam/) page that photographs Mr. James' grave:

<Image src="/static/images/byuctf-2022/mystery1.png" width="400" height="300" />

Removing the dates and names as the description specifies, the flag is `byuctf{murdered_by_a_traitor_and_coward_whose_name_is_not_worthy_to_appear_here}`.

## Buckeye Billy Birthday

</div>

<Challenge
    title="Buckeye Billy Birthday"
    solvers={['Battlemonger', 'sahuang', 'jktrn']}
    category="osint"
    points="500"
    description="Buckeye Billy, our lovely, nutty, history loving friend, has a birthday coming up! Billy is as cryptic as can be, and we have no idea what to get him for his birthday. We did find three hints on written on his desk. Can you help us find where we should buy a gift from?  
        [Hint 1](https://mywordle.strivemath.com/?word=sokhc) [Hint 2](https://mywordle.strivemath.com/?word=yocod) [Hint 3](https://mywordle.strivemath.com/?word=lffep)  
        format: `byuctf{storename}`"
/>

I took a look at the three hints, and they were Wordle games that resulted in `WATER`, `CALLS`, and `PROBE`. Since we were looking for a shop (meaning a location), we immediately turned to [what3words](https://what3words.com/) and stumbled across [this location](https://what3words.com/water.calls.probe) in Charlotte, Ohio:

![Screenshot of what3words location](/static/images/byuctf-2022/bday1.png)

We tried a couple of stores around the area to no avail, until an admin told us in a ticket that we were in the wrong place. By extension, we decided to try out various permutations of `water`, `calls` and `probe`:

| what3word address                                        | Location                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [///water.calls.probe](https://w3w.co/water.calls.probe) | Charlotte, North Carolina |
| [///calls.water.probe](https://w3w.co/calls.water.probe) | Detroit, Michigan         |
| [///probe.water.calls](https://w3w.co/probe.water.calls) | Houston, Texas            |
| [///water.probe.calls](https://w3w.co/water.probe.calls) | Cincinnati, Ohio          |
| [///calls.probe.water](https://w3w.co/calls.probe.water) | Albuquerque, New Mexico   |
| [///probe.calls.water](https://w3w.co/probe.calls.water) | Eastbourne, London        |

Most of them were bogus except [///water.probe.calls](https://what3words.com/water.probe.calls), which was on E. McMillan St, Cincinnati, Ohio. We assumed it was correct (and admin later confirmed) because the nickname "Buckeye Billy" comes from the fact that he loves the [Ohio State University Buckeyes](https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/) football team. (Bonus: The Ohio Buckeye is a type of nut, and the description says that he is "nutty"). Our teammate somehow connected "history-loving" to old stores in Cincinnati, Ohio, and upon a Google search we found:

<Image src="/static/images/byuctf-2022/bday2.png" width="500" height="300" />

The flag is `byuctf{graeters}`. This was a guessy challenge, so don't feel dumb. I felt dumb too.

Step 0 is to find his social media account, which we did by searching "Buckeye Billy" on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/William_buckeye):

![Screenshot of Buckeye Billy's Twitter](/static/images/byuctf-2022/blabbin1.png)

I slowly began to despise him... that Buckeye Billy. That stupid, perfectly circular nuthead with the even stupider BYU sombrero. We gave up on the challenge and I cried to the admin until he got annoyed and agreed to post a global hint:

> the more billy tweeted about something, the more of a hint it might be. The flag is on his account someplace.

He tweeted a lot about song lyrics:

We decided it would be best to create a list of songs, in addition to counting occurrences of topics he discussed (for brainstorming purposes). We ended up with this list:

![Screenshot of brainstorming list](/static/images/byuctf-2022/blabbin3.png)

Hey, check that out in the Songs list. "3 Words", "One Place", "Greater", "Ice Cream"? That sounds a lot like our previous challenge, "Buckeye Billy Birthday." Looks like these were meant to be solved in tandem. By extension, "Man in the Mirror" and "Magic Mirror" were also hinted at, and we found a [tweet](https://twitter.com/William_buckeye/status/1515113600750219265) of Billy posing in front of a mirror with a BYU hat. Uncoincidentally, this is the only mention of BYU in his entire profile (I believe):

The guy at 3:31 is the same as the guy at 2:34, so it's Michael Nesmith from the Monkees.

Looking up "Monkees 43" on Google, we discover that there's actually an old website called [monkeesrule43.com](https://www.monkeesrule43.com/articles.html).

This is where you guess all the names of the Monkees. Not sure of the logical thought process yet. Flag is `byuctf{micky_dolenz}`.

        "**Edit (06/02/22)**: The intended solve was to look at [monkeesrule43.com](https://www.monkeesrule43.com/articles.html). In their [FAQ page](https://www.monkeesrule43.com/faq.html), Question 13 asks:

        > 13.)  What does the weird writing on Micky's page of the Monkees' 2001 summer tourbook mean?
        > - Micky's page is written in a computer keyboard code. Each letter written stands for the letter to the left of it on a computer keyboard. For example, &quot;Zovlu&quot; means Micky & &quot;Jo!&quot; means Hi!

        This intended solution was pretty weird. Whoever wrote this challenge is probably the #1 Beatles fan of all time if they can remember stuff like this."
