## Google Kickstart Round F Experience

Today, I participated in the competitive programming event, Google Kickstart, in their round F. Whilst this competitional format is something I'm not generally used to, the experience was invaluable, and I gained a much stronger insight into the importance of data structures and algorithms than I had previously.

In this competitional format, we were given four questions and around three hours to solve them. Whilst I didn't get close to winning, from this Kickstart competition I learned quite a lot in regards to competitive programming, as well as data structures and algorithms, and has inspired me to practice more to compete in future programming events.
