## Introduction

University is a new and troubling time for some just starting out, especially in technology. In one of the most in-demand and high-paying fields, it is essential to make the most of your time in school in order to break into tech. In this article, I will be sharing my lessons and experiences studying Computer Science at UTS and how I found my way into the tech industry.

## My Background

I entered my undergraduate degree with a strong interest in computing, however, I soon found that my skills and knowledge were not up to par with what was expected of me. It was during my second year when things started to really click and I understood the material more deeply. I joined the UTS Programmers' Society and started attending their regular meetups and social events. This was a great way to meet other students with similar interests, learn more about the tech industry, and get involved in various tech projects.

While my grades were important, I found that my extracurricular activities were just as, if not more important in helping me get into the tech industry. I was able to get internships and work experience through my connections and involvement in the Programmers' society. These experiences were essential in helping me get my foot in the door and eventually land my first full-time job in the tech industry.

As I result I learned that university's biggest asset isn't solely the education but also the social and professional connections that students make as well as personal projects that help you stand out. It is all about making a story that is attractive to future employers.

Most importantly I learned how to not be afraid of putting myself out there and talking to people. The tech industry is all about networking and the sooner you start, the better. Attending meetups, going to tech events, and getting involved in the community were a great help for this. Around this time, I also started building my online presence. With the creation of this blog as well as my Twitter & LinkedIn accounts. Furthermore, creating this blog, starting a GitHub as well as just being active on social media were a great help for this.

All of these activities will not only help you make connections but also help you learn more about the tech industry and what it is like to work in it. It is also a great way to show future employers that you are passionate about tech and are always looking to learn more.

That's enough of my history, though. Let me get to the good stuff – how can YOU maximize your time at university to break into tech?

## Time management for students

As a student, you have a lot on your plate. Between classes, homework, extracurriculars, and socializing, it can be hard to find time to fit everything in. And when you're trying to break into the tech industry, it can feel like you don't have enough time in the day to get everything done.
But with a little bit of planning and some time management techniques, you can make the most of your time at university and set yourself up for success in the tech industry. Here's how:

1. Make a schedule and stick to it

One of the best ways to maximize your time is to create a schedule and stick to it. This will help you make sure you're spending enough time on each task, and it will also help you avoid wasting time.

2. Set priorities

With a busy schedule, it's important to set priorities. Figure out what's most important to you and what can wait. For example, if you're trying to land an internship, you might want to focus on networking and your coursework, and put socializing on the back burner.

3. Don't be afraid to ask for help

There's no shame in asking for help, whether it's from a professor, a friend, or a career counselor. If you're feeling lost or overwhelmed, reach out for support.

With a little bit of planning and some time management techniques, you can make the most of your time at university and set yourself up for success in the tech industry. By making a schedule, setting priorities, taking advantage of your resources, getting involved, and asking for help when you need it, you can maximize your time and make the most of your university experience.

## How to make the most of your university experience

It can be easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day of university life and forget that your time at university is also an opportunity to prepare for your future career. If you're interested in breaking into the tech industry, there are a few things you can do to make the most of your time at university and set yourself up for success.

1. Use your coursework to explore your interests.

If you're not sure what area of tech you want to pursue, use your coursework to explore different areas and find out what interests you the most. There are a lot of different areas within tech, so it's important to find out what you're passionate about before you start applying for jobs.

2. Get involved in extracurricular clubs and activities.

There are often extracurricular clubs and activities related to tech on university campuses. Getting involved in these can help you develop the skills you'll need for a career in tech, and it's also a great way to meet like-minded people.

You can also join professional organizations, such as the ACS (Australian Computing Society) as well as networking on career-oriented Slacks, networking events as well as conferences.

5. Seek out opportunities for internships and co-op placements.

Internships and co-op placements are a great way to gain practical experience in the tech industry. They can also help you make contacts and develop your professional network.

By following these tips, you can make the most of your time at university and set yourself up for success in the tech industry.
